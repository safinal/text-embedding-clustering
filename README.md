# Elastic Deep Autoencoder for Text Embedding Clustering by an Improved Graph Regularization
In this code, a deep autoencoder with an adapted elastic loss for text embedding clustering (EDA-TEC) is proposed. The elastic loss is a combination of the Frobenius norm and , L2,1 -norm to consider both types of noises. Additionally, to maintain the high-dimensional data geometric structure, a modified graph regularization term based on the weighted cosine similarity measure is used. EDA-TEC also improves clustering results by considering the sparsity regularization of the manifold representation data. In this jointly end-to-end deep learning model, better representation and data clustering results are achieved with high accuracy on common datasets compared to existing methods.
